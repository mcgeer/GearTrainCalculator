Produced during Local Hack Day 2015.

## TO DO:
1. Approximations by altering bad inputs.
2. Incorporate rack/worm linear speeds.
3. Incorporate non-axially-paired gear trains. (3 gears meshing in succession)
4. Find a way to determine maxmium testDenominator
5. Test and utilize mcgeer's 'fix' function.
6. Take into account the dimensions of the holding case.
