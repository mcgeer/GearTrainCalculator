# Gear Train Calculator

Generates a set of axially aligned gear pairs that create the provided input/output speed ratio.

This solution will also align with certain constraints that can be placed on it.


Produced during Local Hack Day 2015.

## TO DO:
1. If no solution can be found, try slightly increasing the output speed (large primes) and rerunning. OR SOME OTHER FIX.
2. Incorporate rack/worm linear speeds.
3. Incorporate non-axially-paired gear trains. (3 gears meshing in succession)
4. Find a way to determine maxmium testDenominator
5. Take into account the dimensions of the holding case.
6. Shout "BY JOVE WE HAVE DONE IT"
