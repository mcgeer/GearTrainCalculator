# Gear Train Calculator

Generates a set of axially aligned gear pairs that create the provided input/output speed ratio.

This solution will also align with certain constraints that can be placed on it.


Started as Local Hack Day 2015 project.



## Original TODO:
1. If no solution can be found, try slightly increasing the output speed (large primes) and rerunning. OR SOME OTHER FIX. 
2. Look into the idea of using variable modulus to achieve wonky ratios
3. Incorporate rack/worm linear speeds into optimization problem.
4. Incorporate non-axially-paired gear trains. (3 gears meshing in succession)
5. Find a way to determine maxmium testDenominator
6. Take into account the dimensions of the holding case.
7. Shout "BY JOVE WE HAVE DONE IT"
